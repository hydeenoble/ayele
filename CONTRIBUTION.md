# Setup Web Version Locally

You need to have an HTTP static file server like [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server). 

Navigate to the directory that contains index.html on your terminal and execute

```bash
live-server
```

This should start a server on port 8080, and open the address `https://localhost:8080` on your browser.
